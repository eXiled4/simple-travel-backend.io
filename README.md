# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Hi there!

This repository you're viewing should be viewed alongside the simple-travel-frontend.io, as it serves as the API corresponding with your trip planner.

To get this running run:

* bundle install
* rails db:migrate
* rails db:seed (optional) - inserts a few trips written by the author
* rails s

When the command `rails s` is running, make sure you have already simple-travel-frontend.io installed and running
